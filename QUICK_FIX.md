# âš¡ **Quick Fix - Trigger Deployment NOW**

## **Problem:**
No deployments showing in Render.

## **Solution:**

### **Right Now - Do This:**

1. **Go to:** https://dashboard.render.com/web
2. **Click on your service:** `ghl-oauth-api`
3. **Click:** "Manual Deploy" button (top right)
4. **Select:** "Deploy latest commit" 
5. **Click:** "Deploy"
6. **Watch logs appear!**

---

## **Why This Happens:**

Render doesn't always auto-deploy, especially if:
- Service was created before code was pushed
- GitHub webhooks not configured
- Auto-deploy is disabled

**Solution:** Manual deploy always works!

## **What You'll See:**

### **Immediately:**
```
==> Deploying...
==> Cloning from GitHub...
==> Running build command...
```

### **Within 2-3 Minutes:**
```
==> Build successful âœ…
==> Starting service...
ðŸš€ GHL OAuth API Server running on port 10000
```

### **Service Goes Live:**
Badge changes to **"Live"** âœ…

## **Then Test:**

1. Health: `https://ghl-oauth-api.onrender.com/health`
2. OAuth: `https://ghlvoiceai.captureclient.com/auth/ghl`

Both should work! ðŸŽ‰

**Go to Render dashboard now and click "Manual Deploy"!** ðŸš€
