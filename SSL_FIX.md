# üîí **SSL/HTTPS Fix for Render**

## **The Problem:**
```
ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH
ghlvoiceai.captureclient.com uses an unsupported protocol
```

This means HTTPS isn't ready yet.

## **DNS is Working ‚úÖ**

The domain `ghlvoiceai.captureclient.com` is pointing to Render's servers. Good!

## **What This Error Means:**

SSL certificates take 10-15 minutes to provision after:
1. ‚úÖ DNS is pointing to Render
2. ‚ùå Service is deployed and running

## **Check Service Status:**

### **1. Go to Render Dashboard**
Visit your service: `ghl-oauth-api`

### **2. Check Deployment Status:**
Look at the top - is it:
- ‚úÖ **Live** - Service is running
- ‚è≥ **Building** - Still deploying
- ‚ùå **Failed** - Deployment failed

### **3. If Failed:**
Follow the steps in `UPDATE_RENDER_SETTINGS.md` to update Build and Start commands.

### **4. If Building/Waiting:**
Wait for deployment to complete. Then SSL will provision automatically.

## **Temporary Workaround:**

While waiting for SSL:

1. **Test without custom domain:**
   Visit: `https://ghl-oauth-api.onrender.com/health`

2. **Check if service is running:**
   Should return: `{"status":"healthy","service":"GHL OAuth API"}`

## **SSL Provision Timeline:**

Render automatically provisions SSL certificates, but it takes time:

1. **DNS propagates:** ‚úÖ Already done!
2. **Service deploys:** ‚è≥ Check Render dashboard
3. **SSL provisions:** üïê 10-15 minutes after deployment
4. **HTTPS works:** ‚úÖ Full connection

## **What to Do Now:**

### **Step 1: Verify Service Status**
Go to Render dashboard ‚Üí Check if service is "Live"

### **Step 2: If Not Live:**
Update settings as per `UPDATE_RENDER_SETTINGS.md`

### **Step 3: Wait 10-15 Minutes**
After service is live, SSL will provision automatically

### **Step 4: Test Again**
Try: `https://ghlvoiceai.captureclient.com/health`

Should work without SSL errors!

## **Alternative: Check Certificates**

In Render dashboard:
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Custom Domains**
2. Look for `ghlvoiceai.captureclient.com`
3. Should show "SSL provisioning" or "Active"

If it says "Pending" or "Failed":
- Click **"Refresh"**
- Wait 5-10 minutes
- Try again

## **If Still Fails:**

### **Verify DNS Again:**
```bash
nslookup ghlvoiceai.captureclient.com
```

Should show Render's IP addresses.

### **Check GoDaddy DNS Settings:**
Make sure CNAME is correct:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: ghlvoiceai
Value: [your-render-url].onrender.com
TTL: 3600
```

## **Expected Flow:**

```
DNS Points to Render ‚Üí Service Deploys ‚Üí SSL Provisions ‚Üí HTTPS Works
```

Your DNS is working! Now just need:
- Service to be live
- SSL to provision

## **Quick Check:**

Try this in order:

1. **Service health (without custom domain):**
   `https://ghl-oauth-api.onrender.com/health`

2. **OAuth test (without custom domain):**
   `https://ghl-oauth-api.onrender.com/auth/ghl`

3. **Custom domain (after SSL):**
   `https://ghlvoiceai.captureclient.com/health`

**The SSL error is expected until service is deployed and SSL provisions!** üîí

Check your Render dashboard for deployment status.
